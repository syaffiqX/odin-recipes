    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken wings are one of those well-loved, crowd-pleasing
        appetizers that work for pretty much ant occasion.
        Whether it's a smaller gathering or a big buffet, a plate of
        chicken wings usually the first thing to go.
    </p>

    <p>
        And so they should be! They're simple to eat, tasty, and feel
        more substantial than a bowl of chips or a veggie platter.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of my favorite wing recipes is for sweet and sticky
        Japanese-inspired teriyaki chicken wings cooked in the
        pressure cooker.

        <strong>NOTE:</strong> You can buy "Party Wings" at the grocery store which
        are wings that have already been broken down into their
        parts: the drumette and the flat. But I often buy whole wings
        because breaking them down is easy and it's cheaper. See
        headnotes for more instructions on breaking down chicken wings.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons mirin</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sake</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic, about 1 medium garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger, from about a 1-inch knob</li>
        <li>3 pounds chicken wing drumettes and flats</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To chicken sauce:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 to 5 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>4 to 5 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To serve:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the teriyaki sauce:</li>

        <p>
            Combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, brown
            sugar, garlic, and ginger. Stir to mix in the sugar (it won’t
            completely dissolve and that’s OK).
        </p>

        <li>Pressure cook the wings:</li>

        <p>
            Combine the teriyaki sauce and wings in the pressure
            cooker. Toss the wings to coat. Seal the pressure
            cooker and make sure the steam valve is set to
            “sealing”.

        </p>

        <p>
            Press the “Poultry” button and adjust the time to 10
            minutes. Make sure it is set to “high pressure.”
        </p>

        <p>
            The pressure cooker will come to pressure in 15
            minutes, then cook for 10 minutes.
        </p>

        <li>Vent the pressure:</li>

        <p>
            Once the pressure cooker is done cooking, do a quick
            release of the pressure by carefully moving the steam
            valve to the “venting” setting. (I wear an oven mitt and
            use a wooden spoon to flick the valve because I’m
            overly cautious.)

        </p>

        <li>Get ready for broiling:</li>

        <p>
            While the steam is being released, turn your oven
            broiler on. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum
            foil and lightly coat the foil with cooking oil spray.

        </p>

        <li>Broil the chicken wings:</li>

        <p>
            Once the steam has been released, open the pressure
            cooker. Using tongs, move the wings to the prepared
            baking sheet and place under the broiler for 4 to 5
            minutes or until the chicken skin is starting to char.

        </p>

        <p>
            Flip all the wings and repeat to char the other side. 

        </p>

        <li>Reduce the teriyaki sauce:</li>

        <p>
            While the chicken wings are broiling, thicken the
            teriyaki sauce. Start by pressing the “sauté” button on
            the pressure cooker.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you plan on serving the wings at room temperature,
            stir together 4 teaspoons of cornstarch and 4
            teaspoons of soy sauce in a small bowl until the
            cornstarch is dissolved, then add to the simmering
            teriyaki sauce.
           
        </p>

        <p>
            If you plan on serving the wings hot, use all 5
            teaspoons of both ingredients.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cook the sauce until it starts to boil, stirring
            frequently, about 3 minutes. The sauce should start to
            thicken a bit and look like maple syrup, but won’t look
            super thick. Don’t worry, it will thicken further as it
            cools.
        </p>
      
        <li>Toss the broiled wings with the teriyaki sauce:</li>

        <p>
            Turn the pressure cooker off. Once the wings are done
            in the broiler, transfer them back to the pressure
            cooker with the thickened sauce.
        </p>
        <p>
            Toss to coat the wings, then move them to a serving
            platter.
        </p>
        
        <li>Serve:</li>
        
        <p>
            Sprinkle wings with sesame seeds and sliced green
            onions and serve hot or room temperature.
