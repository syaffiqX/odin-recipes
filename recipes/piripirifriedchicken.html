    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Piri piri fried chicken is a twist on classic buttermilk fried
        chicken that incorporates popular African and Portuguese
        piri piri seasonings, such as bird’s eye chili peppers,
        paprika, salt, lemon peels, oregano, and garlic, to create
        citrusy, garlicky, and herbal notes.

        I love exploring different spices in order to come up with
        new and exciting family meals. For me, this happens
        through travel (overseas), but it also happens at my local
        spice stores. During a "trip" one afternoon, I stumbled
        across a piri piri spice blend, did some research on the
        spice, and the rest was history! As my creative juices
        started flowing, I came up with this piri piri fried chicken.

    <p>
        This fried chicken recipe is perfect for family dinners,
        weeknight meals, or picnics. Serve with a side of greens
        and coleslaw and dig in!

    </ul>

    <h3>For the flour coating:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (272g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons piri piri spice blend</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For frying chicken:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Peanut oil or canola oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the marinade:</li>

        <p>
            In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, salt, piri piri
            spice blend, onion powder, and garlic powder. Add the
            chicken to this buttermilk mixture. Cover with plastic
            wrap and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 8
            to 24 hours.
        </p>

        <li>Make the flour coating for chicken:</li>

        <p>
            In a large plastic bag or in a large bowl combine the
            flour, piri piri spice blend, black pepper, paprika, garlic
            powder, onion powder, and salt.
        </p>

        <li>Dredge the chicken pieces in flour mixture:</li>

        <p>
            Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and
            allow the excess buttermilk to drip off. Individually
            dredge each piece into the flour mixture making sure
            the chicken is fully coated. Shake off the excess flour,
            place the chicken pieces on a sheet pan.
        </p>

        <li>Let the floured chicken rest:</li>

        <p>
            Let the floured chicken pieces sit at room temperature
            for 30 minutes to help the flour adhere to the chicken
            and let the chicken come to room temperature.
        </p>

        <li>Heat the frying oil:</li>

        <p>
            While the chicken sits for 30 minutes, fill the Dutch
            oven half way full with oil. Heat the oil, over medium-
            high heat until the oil reaches 325°F when using a
            kitchen thermometer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alternatively, to tell if your oil is ready for frying you
            can add a pinch of flour into the oil, and when it
            begins to sizzle, your oil is ready.
        </p>

        <li>Fry the chicken:</li>

        <p>
            Cook the chicken in batches by adding a few pieces of
            chicken to the pot and fry for about 15 minutes,
            turning halfway through the cooking time. Your
            chicken is full cooked through when the thickest part
            of the chicken pieces reaches 165°F when inserted
            with a digital thermometer.
        </p>

        <li>Place chicken on a rack to drain excess oil:</li>

        <p>
            When the chicken is golden brown and cooked
            through, remove the chicken using tongs and place on
            a rack over a baking sheet to drain any excess oil.
        </p>

        <li>Serve:</li>
        
        <p>
            Serve fried chicken warm along with your favorite
            sides
        </p>
    </ol>
