    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fried chikenis one of my favorite foods, hands down. I
        grew up mostly eating quick, skillet-fried chicken, but we
        would always have a bottle of hot sauce on the table to turn
        up the flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, classic buttermilk fried chicken gets a spicy twist,
        infusing it with spice instead of treating it as an
        afterthought. Chicken parts get marinated in a spicy
        buttermilk mixture, dredged in seasoned flour with a kick,
        and then fried in a skillet until crisp and golden brown on
        the outside, and juicy on the inside.

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        
        <li>Marinate chicken in buttermilk mixture:</li>
        
        <p>
            Mix the buttermilk, hot sauce, salt, black pepper,
            cayenne, and garlic powder in a large bowl.
            Put the chicken pieces in the buttermilk mixture and coat
            completely.
        </p>

        <p>
            Marinate at least 8 hours and up to 24 in the
            refrigerator.
        </p>

        <li>Dredge chicken:</li>

        <p>
            Remove the chicken from the refrigerator. In a large
            paper or plastic (sturdy) bag, mix flour with black
            pepper, cayenne, salt, and garlic powder.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A couple pieces at a time, add the chicken to the
            seasoned flour and shake until thoroughly coated.
            Shake off any excess flour and let the dredged
            chicken pieces sit on a platter at room temperature
            for 20 to 30 minutes.
        </p>

        <li>Heat oil in thick-bottomed pan:</li>

        <p>
            Meanwhile, heat 1/2 inch of oil in a large, heavy-
            bottomed skillet on medium heat (cast iron, stainless
            steel, or anodized aluminum—something that can take
            the heat). Heat until a pinch of flour gently sizzles
            when dropped in the hot oil (but not so hot that the
            pan is smoking), about 325°F. Remember when
            working with hot oil, always have a pan lid close by,
            just in case of grease fire.
        </p>

        <li>Fry the chicken:</li>

        <p>
            Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot
            oil in the pan and fry until golden brown all over, about
            8 to 10 minutes per side, flipping the chicken as
            needed with tongs. When done, the meat should
            register 165°F in the thickest part using a digital
            thermometer. 
        </p>

        <li>Remove to a rack to drain excess oil:</li>

        <p>
            Use tongs to remove chicken from pan. Place on a
            rack over a cookie sheet or a platter layered with
            paper towels for the excess oil to drain. Serve warm.
